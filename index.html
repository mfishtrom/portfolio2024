        I aspire to design things that will stand the test of time.<br><br>
        
        I will involve my community, not abstract users, in my process.<br><br>
        
        My mind is always open to new and evolving ideas.<br><br>
        
        The world is rough enough; my designs will bring comfort to viewers. <br><br>

    <p><b class="title">About</b><br>
        <div class="about" style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
            Madi Fishtrom is a candidate for a Master of Arts in Design. 
            She previously was a project manager for creatives, and found herself drawn to being the 
            one creating the work, not managing it. This led her to San Francisco State University to pursue a degree in Design. 
            As the daughter of educators, Madi feels most at home in a space of learning and growth. During her first semester of 
            graduate school, Madi was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and underwent six months of treatment while remaining a 
            full-time student. Her dedication to her education and passion for equitable healthcare leads her interest to a career 
            in medical service design, research, and teaching. She is currently working on research for her creative work project, 
            "Designing Better Access to Holistic Care for Cancer Patients," which will house a database of information on practices 
            to undergo in conjunction with traditional medical treatment for cancer patients.
